by Kristof Keppens

===================
/ Install         /
===================

Copy this directory to the plugin directory of your CKEditor 
installation and add the plugin to the config.js file as with
other plugins.

===================
/ Set-Up	  /
===================

- Add a correct filebrowser configuration in your config.js file, ex.
  config.filebrowserStreamingPlayerBrowseUrl = CKEDITOR.basePath+'php/browse.php,type=stream'. 
  Change this to correspond with your environment. Make sure the filebrowser 
  returns an url to the streaming resource.
- Change the config settings in the plugin.js file. Movie should be the url to 
  the flowplayer swf file. ExtraFlashVars gives the possibility to add extra 
  configuration parameters, such as logo's, plugins, controls url, ... . 
  Check the flowplayer site ( www.flowplayer.org ) for more info.
